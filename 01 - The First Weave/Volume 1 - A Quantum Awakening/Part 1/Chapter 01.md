Professor Kael Ithrin gripped the bowl of the bathroom washstand till his knuckles turned white. Hunched over with his eyes closed, he gave a shuddering sigh and straightened. He opened his eyes to glare at his visage in the wall mirror. It looked back at him. Sharp features, close-cropped thinning brown to grey hair and an unruly beard, quite at odds with his otherwise unnotable features. He adjusted his designer glasses, which gave him the appearance of authority he often felt he lacked.
“Don’t judge me!” He muttered, “You knew it would come to this.”
The entry door clattered open, and Professor Burnham, of Natural Philosophy, burst in.
“Hell’s teeth, Ithrin, but you’ve got a packed venue today!” He manoeuvred his bulk into the nearest vacant stall and locked the door.
“I must say, I do have some qualms about the subject matter, but better out than in, eh?”
“Interesting choice of venue, though!” he continued. 
Professor. Ithrin closed his eyes again as various noises from the stall reinforced Professor Burnham’s advice.
Professor Ithrin squared his shoulders.
“Right then, might as well get it over with.”, he said.
He strode out of the bathroom with renewed purpose. His Head of Department, Professor Eleanor Vance, was waiting. Eleanor didn’t say anything, just nodded.
She didn’t need to.
Whatever the outcome of the next hour, science as it existed would be rocked, perhaps changed forever. Pandora’s box would be opened, and the key thrown away. Kael knew this. Since his appointment to the long vacant seat of the Cavendish Professorship at Cambridge University, his work had taken unexpected turns, fuelled by sudden and distinct revelations. That this was very much at odds with how business as usual was conducted, he did not doubt what sort of reception he was about to receive, and what could happen afterwards.
Together, Kael and Eleanor strode towards the lecture room where Kael was to give his speech, a speech years in the making. Yet, this speech could or would, in an instant, undo a lifetime’s work.
Beyond, a tumult of conversations from attendees already in place and growing impatient could be heard.
“Good luck.”, said Eleanor. She was all too aware of the likely consequences, but had resolutely stuck with Kael, even as his discoveries became ever more profound in their implications.
Kael looked at Eleanor, nodded once more and then pushed his way through the door to the lecture room beyond.
Eleanor strode to the front of the room and positioned herself behind a lecturer’s podium.
“Ladies and gentlemen, friends and colleagues, for those of you who may not know me, I am Professor Eleanor Vance, the Head of Department at the Cavendish Laboratory at this most venerable of institutions, our beloved Cambridge. I shall dispense with the normal preamble, for it gives me great pleasure to introduce Professor Kael Ithrin, our current Cavendish Professor of Physics at the Cavendish Laboratory. Professor Ithrin has prepared a talk, the content of which I am sure will be of keen interest to you all. Please, put your hands together and give a very warm welcome, Professor Kael Ithrin.”
Eleanor took a seat in the front row as Kael took to the podium to polite applause from the audience. They had discussed various options for putting the audience into a receptive mode as quickly as possible, and the uniting effect of applause seemed the most appropriate. Kael gripped the sides of the podium, unconsciously mirroring his earlier stance at the wash basin, and seemed to look straight through his expectant audience as he began to speak.
“The history of science shows that even during that phase of her progress in which she devotes herself to improving the accuracy of the numerical measurement of quantities with which she has long been familiar, she is preparing the materials for the subjugation of new regions, which would have remained unknown if she had contented with the rough guide of the earlier pioneers”, said Kael.
Kael paused. Naturally, many in the lecture room would be familiar with the quote. And so, the seeds of interest were sown.
Kael continued. He intended to warm the audience up before delivering what his American colleagues would no doubt describe as a curveball.
“But I did not say those words,” he continued,  “James Clerk Maxwell did. In this very room!” he stated.
“Of course, it was called the Devonshire then, and the institution we know and love today was very different. Academics were only beginning to realise the need for structure and rigour within the scientific discipline, the emerging need for laboratories, the facilities, the pedagogy that would be required, the very underpinnings of our discipline we take for granted today were just that, emergent!”
Kael turned his full gaze on his audience. Piercing brown eyes took in his listeners.
Unsurprisingly, his audience represented a diverse range of interests, encompassing a broad spectrum of the sciences. Everybody wanted to know what Kael had to say and how they might benefit.
This was evident by the presence of Victoria Ashworth, Professor of Materials Science, and Angela Santos-Rivera, Professor of Physical Chemistry. Kael had heard their respective departments might be in line for funding cuts as the UK turned its long-term strategy for the sciences elsewhere. Things must be grim, Kael decided, if they were present at his talk.	Others in the audience, Kael would have been amazed if they had not attended.
Indeed, disappointed.
But they had not. Kael noted the presence of Elena Marchetti, the Professor of Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics. Next to her, as if they were best friends, sat Tomoko Nakamura, Lecturer in Quantum Theory.
Kael was both glad and, he had to admit, worried that there was representation from his own Department. He worried, as he was positive that the strongest objections would come from within.
Another of his own, Michael Okafor, the Professor of Experimental Quantum Physics, sat at the front of the lecture room, his expression indecipherable.
There were more, representing an unvoiced middle ground.
Readers in Quantum Dynamics and Optics had placed themselves to the rear, and even the Department of Chemistry had found someone to send, although Kael did not know their name.
Almost hidden at the rear left, Kael spied Priya Anderson, Reader in Quantum Dynamics. I wonder, mused Kael, how she will remember this day.
“Yet,” he went on, “their thirst for knowledge, their eternal quest to examine the world in ever-reducing minutiae cannot be disclaimed. Their inquisitiveness, enthusiasm, and zest for knowledge propelled the British Empire to greatness, whether for good or ill. The phrase ‘standing on the shoulders of giants’ has never been more apt than when applied to the early scientific community.”
Kael began to pace as he elaborated on his premise.
“Let us examine these giants, such that they may serve as a preamble to the main discourse, reduced to an allegorical apperitif before the main meal, the support act before the headliner!”
There was muttering in the audience and shared glances between neighbours, but the audience remained quiescent. Such was the interest in Kael’s talk, a talk of which the context had more in common with hypothesis and gossip than actual quantitative substance. The fact that the lecture room was packed said a great deal.
Rumours had been flying among and between the faculties; it was only to be expected. Many permanent appointees counted their colleagues as friends, mentors, sometimes more. But they also knew they competed. They competed for funding, for increased publishing visibility, and career advancement. Not so much publish or die, but publish till you die.
Jealousy and guarded secrets abounded, and just a hint of a discovery, a mathematics problem solved here, a ground-breaking advance in biology there, was enough to provoke much behind-the-hand muttering amongst the cloisters.
Despite Kael’s attempts at secrecy, his work, accompanied by late nights in the laboratory, had inevitably invited scrutiny. What was he up to? Many of his esteemed colleagues wondered what he was working on. In part, Kael had been forced to call the meeting to give his talk before the rumours gained substance, while he could give it under his own terms.
Kael knew that the fact he’d been forced into action would likely play against him. His findings were clear. His argument, less so.
Ksel pushed these thoughts aside and continued.
“On June 16th, 1865, James Clerk Maxwell sent his groundbreaking unification theory to the printers for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. At a stroke, Maxwell unified electricity, magnetism, and light into a single theory of electromagnetism, demonstrating that light is an electromagnetic wave that travels at a constant speed.
Heinrich Hertz proved that electromagnetic waves existed beyond visible light, and the floodgates to knowledge were thrown open!
Ah, you wonder what this pontification is leading to, do you? You shall see, yes, you shall!
How can one truly grasp the importance of a discovery without appreciating what came before?
Max Planck surely appreciated the work of Maxwell and Hertz, as he proved that energy comes in indivisible units, not streams. Remember this piece of history well, for we will come full circle soon enough!”
Kael paused to take a sip of water and to measure his audience via a sidelong glance. In truth, he was padding out his introduction while another part of his brain attempted to anticipate the questions, accusations and more that would probably follow at his talk’s conclusion.
Kael was satisfied that he had not yet lost his audience. No, they were too intent on being the first to learn about whatever he’d been working on all these years.
“Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the flood gates were open,” he continued, “the discoveries kept coming. Only a few years after Hertz’s revelations, a Swiss patent clerk, one Albert Einstein, demonstrated that light exhibits both wave and particle properties, and crudely speaking, that you can have one, but not the other.”
“Something quantum, he’s discovered some advancement in quantum understanding, mark my words,” said Professor Nakamura.
“Gah!” spat Professor Marchetti, “If he’s unified general relativity with quantum mechanics, we might as well pack up and bloody well retire!”
“Shhh!” a colleague beside Marchetti admonished.
Kael, meanwhile, had moved on.
“Einstein was truly a giant among his peers, but when Niels Bohr realised that electrons could leap between levels without existing between them, things became interesting. Bohr couldn’t have known it then, but his discovery had opened the door to what would become known as the science of Quantum Mechanics!”
Kael beamed at his audience. It was a genuine and disarming smile, and to those who took Kael at face value, entirely outside of expectations. Kael’s sudden display of warmth had a strange effect as a perceptible easing of a hitherto unacknowledged tension in the room could be felt.
“If you’ll pardon me, by indulging in my rather clumsy pun,” Kael said.
His audience tittered and relaxed some more.
Kael himself did not relax. He’d bought some time, but likely not enough. He groaned inside at the thought.
Puns be damned.
“As astounding as these discoveries were,” he continued, “they paled compared to what came next. In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles had wave-like qualities. You could apply a universal principle to all matter, not just light! Standing on Planck’s shoulders, de Broglie set the stage for the rise of Quantum Mechanics.”
“It is,” groaned Nakamura. “I’ll never get funding again.”
Kael paused. Time indeed. Never enough time, despite his recent discoveries having proved the falsity of any attempt to claim so. The irony was palpable.
Kael made a decision. He’d had quite enough of pandering to the masses.
Overcome by the pleb mob, or devoured by academic wolves, Kael had decided he was past caring.
In the front row, Eleanor stiffened in her seat. She’d perceived the subtle change in Kael’s attitude.
“Heisenberg! Schrödinger! Podolksky! Rosen!” Kael punctuated each name of an eminent scientist with a stab of his index finger into the air. “They showed the absurdity of Quantum Mechanics. You can measure the position of the very small, but do not expect to measure its location! Is the cat in a box dead or alive? Neither! It is not dead or alive until you observe the potentially unfortunate feline. We can prove the existence of light as a particle and a wave, but try observing both simultaneously and you will come unstuck.”
Kael returned to pacing.
“The absurdity continued. Two atoms placed at either end of a galaxy could be made to affect each other simultaneously. How could that be? We know from Einstein’s equations that nothing with mass can travel at the speed of light without becoming infinitely massive, and even light would take billions of years to travel across galaxies.
To make matters worse, the absurdity could be quantitatively measured, qualified and proved. Physics, my esteemed friends and colleagues, was broken. The physics of the very large and the very small failed to reconcile. As the decades passed and the subject of Quantum Mechanics came under increased scrutiny, entanglement proved impossible to explain.”
Kael took another sip of water and carefully placed the glass back on the lectern. Incredible, he mused, momentarily distracted. How something so seemingly solid was not. The glass only seemed to be touching the lectern.
Kael returned to the subject matter.
“It was not until over a hundred years after Maxwell that technology caught up with the theory. Quantum computing had long been theorised, but it wasn’t until 2001 that IBM created the first example. It was pitiful, of course, but as a validation of the principle, it was a triumph. I’ll admit that I was caught up in the hype. I believed that we’d ushered in a new technological golden era that would push aside silicon computing, itself only barely established for mass consumption.”
Kael frowned.
“How wrong I was. How could I have known then that my enthusiasm was ahead of its time?”
The audience joined Eleanor in sudden rapt attention, although for different reasons.
“It took twenty years. Twenty years! But finally, the advances came. Quantum computers can do tasks that modern computers cannot. A task that takes an inordinate amount of time for a silicon-based computer, a Quantum computer can do in moments.
First, the computational difference could be measured in days, then years, hundreds of years and eventually, even thousands.”
Kael paused. No time like the present, he thought. He wondered what kind of colloquialisms his descendants would create.
“Yes, not until very recently has the technology caught up. Only recently has the progress of quantum computing evolved to the point where the most powerful quantum computer can achieve in 5 minutes what a ‘normal’ computer could achieve in 10 septillion years. This is a truly staggering advance.”
He had them now. He knew what the audience was expecting. The revelation of a grand unifying theory that might usher in a new era of scientific understanding and advancement.
Fools.
“And yet, as incredible as the latest achievements in quantum computing are, we are still 20 years away from greater adoption, never mind mass consumerism. Like the promise of nuclear fusion, mass market quantum computing remains just out of reach.”
Kael smiled once more, but there was nothing friendly about it. He could sense the growing confusion and restlessness of his audience. Kael’s talk had drifted from physics to the far less interesting topic of Computer Science.
“How unfortunate that all that effort was misplaced,” Kael said, shaking his head. “How unfortunate that entrepreneurs and business people sought to tread the already well-worn path of traditional computing. How sad that they failed to make the obvious connection, the connection that was there all along.”
Eleanor closed her eyes. Kael continued, leaving no room for an interdiction.
“Earlier this year, Professor Vance and I conducted a double-blind study, which made the first quantitative record of meditation-induced quantum effects. EEG readings revealed coherent quantum field fluctuations during deep states of samadhi. In short, we demonstrated that human consciousness could directly interface with quantum fields!”
The uproar was immediate from an audience who felt they had been hoodwinked. Elena nudged Tomoko and offered a humourless grin at him.
“Well, now, that was unexpected.” She said.
Nakamura shook his head, bewildered.
Kael pressed on.
“Yes! Our test subject stilled his mind until he gained such focus that he could touch the quantum world. Together, they discovered the irrefutable existence of what I have termed ‘The Eternal Thread’. Nakamura’s subject was able to reach out and connect with it. Yes, of course it was fleeting, but it was measurable!”
Kael paused. That pun had been worth the effort, but had gone unheard.
Marchetti was of Bologna stock and had already heard enough.
“Have you lost your mind, man?” she cried, “Are we to believe you gathered us all here hoping to have us believe you have discovered telepathy?”
“Certainly not!” Kael responded, “Something far more profound than mere metaphysical quackery.”
“You’re claiming conscious observation alone can manipulate quantum field configurations?” she continued, among much confused mutterings from the audience. “Show me the Hamiltonian! Do you have a mathematical framework for min-matter coupling? Let us peer review that! The decoherence timescales alone make this impossible at macroscopic scales.”
“This is the problem with classical thinking,” Kael countered, “I can confirm, yes, the Hamiltonian indeed does exist! But it operates through quantum fluctuations in the spacetime foam. If you are prompted to consider Wheekler’s theory, you would not be too far off the mark. The coupling occurs via microtubules in neurons, creating quantum coherent states. Yes, I simplify in a most grotesque fashion, but accept my gist. I do have the mathematical frameworks, fear not, based on extensions of the Many Worlds interpretation.”
Nakamura jumped in.
“You’re describing violations of unitarity and energy conservation. The brain operates at 310 Kelvin. The thermal fluctuations alone would destroy any quantum coherence in nanoseconds. Your ’Eternal Thread’ would collapse under decoherence faster than you could think of it.”
Kael smiled another humourless smile. So far, the responses were as expected.
He still felt great sadness, as that meant the future was already playing out.
“A rational argument, Tomoko, yes. But let me say in response that’s exactly what we need for the Eternal Thread. It’s a stabilising quantum field that maintains coherence across macroscopic scales. The brain doesn’t need to maintain coherence; it just needs to interface with the pre-existing quantum substrate. Temperature becomes irrelevant when you’re working with stabilised vacuum fluctuations.”
Kael fixed Nakamura with a piercing stare.
“The ability for the brain to be formed into a tool of pure focus and concentration. That, my friend, is the all-important key. Quantum Mechanics tells us that the underlying quantum universe constantly interacts with our macroscopic world. Quantum foam causes particles to continually spring in and out of existence. You can hardly be surprised to learn this also happens within the brain. The secret is to tune the brain to the point where we can take advantage of these fluctuations.”
Professor Michael Okafor stood up. 
“Professor Ithrin. Kael.” He said. “I think there is much confusion amongst us. You ask us here today, with hardly any premise, and present to us, frankly, a rather fantastical study. A study for which, I add, there is no paper for peer review, nor details on how we as academics might seek to replicate the experiment. You say that you have proofs, but we, sir, have not seen them. Are you asking us to take your findings, such as they are, at face value? We are friends, you and I. But I fear you have departed from the scientific principle.”
Okafor’s statement brought a chorus of affirmation from the audience.
“Yet,” thought Kael, “here they remain, still.”
Okafur continued.
“I need to see your experimental setup, control groups, and reproducible data”, he said.  “How are you measuring these 'thread manipulations'? What's your signal-to-noise ratio? This sounds like confirmation bias masquerading as physics.”
Inwardly, Ksel was pleased at Professor Okafor’s insight, and he was buoyed by the readily available answer he had prepared.
“Assuredly, I understand your scepticism,” replied Kael, “but reproducibility requires trained practitioners. It's like asking someone to reproduce laser experiments without understanding coherent light. I can demonstrate small-scale effects right now - perhaps, we might watch a coin flip land heads ten times in a row through probability thread manipulation."
Professor Okafur shook his head.
“Ah, Kael,” he said, “I fear you are done for.”
There was no prearranged signal, no consensus; the session broke up as attendees took to their feet to voice their opinions to colleagues and Kael himself. Kael saw Eleanor cornered and pitied her, for he had kept much that was important to himself. Kael hated himself for doing so, but it was necessary.
Foreseen.
Kael withstood the demands and criticisms as long as he could, until he could take no more, and then he fled. He fled back to the sanctuary of his laboratory, locking the door behind him.
The date, May 15, 2050, would later be recognised as the moment humanity first publicly acknowledged the possibility of conscious reality manipulation, even if nobody in the lecture room audience recognised the significance at the time.
